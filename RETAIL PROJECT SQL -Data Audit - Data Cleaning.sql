/*
Cust_order CTE: Aggregates customer order information by summing up the total amount (Total_Amount) for each Customer_id and Order_id, and rounding it off to the nearest integer.

Orderpayment_grouped CTE: Aggregates payment data from the Orders_Payement table by summing up the payment_value for each Order_id and rounding it to the nearest integer.

Match_order CTE: Performs an inner join between Cust_order and Orderpayment_grouped based on Order_id and ensures that the total amount matches the total payment value.

Final Selection: Inserts the results of the Match_order CTE (where total order amount equals payment value) into a new table called Matched_order_1.

/*
i. Cust_order CTE: This Common Table Expression (CTE) aggregates the total amount spent per customer for each order in the `Orders` table, rounding the total amount to the nearest integer.

ii. Orderpayment_grouped CTE: This CTE calculates the total payment value for each order from the `Orders_Payment` table, grouping by the order and rounding the total payment value.

iii. Null_list CTE: A right join is performed between `Cust_order` and `Orderpayment_grouped` to find orders where the total amount from `Orders` doesn't match the payment amount from `Orders_Payment`. It filters for cases where no matching customer ID is found, meaning the total order amount is not equal to the payment amount.

iv. Remaining_ids CTE: This part joins the mismatched payment orders from `Null_list` with the `Orders` table to retrieve the correct customer ID and order information where there are discrepancies in payment values.

v. Final Output: The result from `Remaining_ids`, which contains orders with mismatched payment and total amounts, is stored into a new table named `Remaining_orders_1`.
